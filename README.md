# Time Series Analysis Experiments ðŸ˜Š

Welcome to a collection of experiments focused on forecasting retail sales using time series analysis. With historical retail data spanning the last 4 years, this project aims to predict future sales and uncover trends over time.

## Project Overview

- **Data Source:**  
    The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting) and contains detailed sales records across various U.S. states.

- **Dataset Details:**  
    The data comprises 9,800 rows and 18 columns, offering a comprehensive view of the retail store's operations.

- **Objective:**  
    - Predict product names and sales values based on customer information and specified future date ranges.
    - Develop a reusable codebase that supports large-scale prediction, retraining, data versioning, and model versioning.

## Approach

- **Experimentation:**  
    Multiple forecasting methods will be employed to achieve optimal predictions.  
- **Reusability:**  
    The design emphasizes code reusability to facilitate future enhancements and scalability.
